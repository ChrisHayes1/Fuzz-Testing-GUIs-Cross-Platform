Directory: cores

This directory contains the core files for some of the clients that
crashed when tested.

Filename conventions: Each core file has a name:
	core.<utility-name>.<timestamp>.gz
where <utility-name> is the name of the client that core dumped and
<timestamp> gives the date and time when the core dump occurred.  The
timestamp gives the date, the month-name, and the time in hours and
minutes.  All core dumps were generated in 1994.

The files have been compressed using gzip version 1.2.4 of 18 August
1993 on a Sun SPARCstation 10/40 (sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3).  The core
files were generated on the same platform.
